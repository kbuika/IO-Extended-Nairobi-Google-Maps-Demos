<h1 align="center">Google Maps APIs Demos</h1>


## Overview

A collection of demos I made at I/O Extended 2022 Nairobi


## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

For the Vite projects, you will probably need to install the vite cli globally and then you can cd into them and run

```bash
# Start it
$ npm run dev

```


You will also need to provide a Google Maps API and enable the relevant APIs within like (Distance Matrix, Maps Javascript API)



### Happy Hacking!!
